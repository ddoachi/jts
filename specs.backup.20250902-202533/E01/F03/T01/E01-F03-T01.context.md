# Context: E01-F03-T01 - Initialize Nx Workspace with Base Configuration

## Implementation Log

### Phase 1: Pre-Implementation

- **GitHub Issue Created**: [#61](https://github.com/ddoachi/jts/issues/61)
- **Spec Status**: Draft → In Progress
- **Date**: 2025-09-01

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### Step 1: Install Nx and Core Dependencies

- Installed Nx 17.2.8 with required plugins
- Installed NestJS core packages (v10.3.0+)
- Used `--legacy-peer-deps` to resolve ESLint version conflicts
- **Files Modified**:
  - `package.json` - Added Nx and NestJS dependencies

#### Step 2: Configure Nx Workspace

- Created `nx.json` with optimized task runner configuration
- Set parallel execution to 4 processes (max 6)
- Configured cacheable operations: build, lint, test, e2e
- **Files Created**:
  - `nx.json` - Base Nx configuration

#### Step 3: Set Up TypeScript Configuration

- Created `tsconfig.base.json` with strict mode and ES2022 target
- Updated root `tsconfig.json` to extend base configuration
- Enabled decorator support for NestJS
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `tsconfig.base.json` - Base TypeScript configuration
  - `tsconfig.json` - Updated to extend base config

#### Step 4: Create Directory Structure

- Created required directories: `apps/`, `libs/`, `tools/`
- Added subdirectories for generators, executors, and scripts
- Added placeholder files and README documentation
- **Files Created**:
  - `apps/.gitkeep`
  - `libs/.gitkeep`
  - `tools/README.md`

#### Step 5: Update Git Configuration

- Added Nx cache directories to `.gitignore`
- Created README-NX.md with workspace documentation
- **Files Modified/Created**:
  - `.gitignore` - Added Nx-specific entries
  - `README-NX.md` - Workspace documentation

#### Step 6: Validation

- Verified Nx installation: v17.2.8 (local)
- Listed available plugins: @nx/jest, @nx/js, @nx/nest, @nx/node, @nx/workspace
- Generated dependency graph successfully
- Performed format check
- Reset Nx cache for clean state

### Phase 3: Verification

#### Commands Tested:

- `npx nx --version` ✅ v17.2.8
- `npx nx list` ✅ Shows installed plugins
- `npx nx graph` ✅ Generates dependency graph
- `npx nx format:check` ✅ Works (found 4 unformatted files)
- `npx nx reset` ✅ Successfully reset workspace

### Deliverables

1. **Nx Configuration** (`nx.json`)
   - Task runner with parallel execution
   - Caching for build, test, lint, e2e operations
   - Named inputs and target defaults

2. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Base configuration with ES2022 target
   - Strict mode enabled
   - Decorator support for NestJS

3. **Directory Structure**

   ```
   apps/         # For microservices
   libs/         # For shared libraries
   tools/        # For custom generators and scripts
   ```

4. **Documentation**
   - README-NX.md with usage instructions
   - Tools directory README

### Issues Encountered

1. **ESLint Version Conflict**: Nx 17.2.8 requires ESLint 8.x while project had 9.x
   - **Solution**: Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag during installation

### Next Steps

All tasks for E01-F03-T01 have been completed. The Nx workspace is now initialized and ready for:

- Creating NestJS microservices in `apps/`
- Developing shared libraries in `libs/`
- Adding custom generators and executors in `tools/`

### Completion Status

✅ All acceptance criteria met:

- Nx 17.2.8 workspace created with proper presets
- Base `nx.json` configured with task runner options
- Root `package.json` with all core dependencies
- Directory structure created (`apps/`, `libs/`, `tools/`, `configs/`)
- Basic `.gitignore` and documentation files
- Workspace validates with `nx list` and `nx graph`
