## Implementation Log

### 2025-08-31 - Initial Implementation

**Completed Tasks:**

1. ✅ Installed all code quality dependencies
   - ESLint and TypeScript plugins
   - Prettier and integrations
   - Husky and lint-staged
   - Commitlint
   - Pre-commit package

2. ✅ Configured ESLint for TypeScript/NestJS
   - Created `.eslintrc.js` with TypeScript parser
   - Added rules for imports, TypeScript, and Jest
   - Configured ignore patterns

3. ✅ Configured Prettier with team standards
   - Created `.prettierrc` with formatting rules
   - Added `.prettierignore` for excluded paths

4. ✅ Set up Husky and git hooks
   - Initialized Husky with `yarn husky init`
   - Created pre-commit hook for lint-staged
   - Created pre-push hook for affected tests
   - Created commit-msg hook for commitlint

5. ✅ Configured lint-staged for selective file checking
   - Created `lint-staged.config.js`
   - Set up file pattern matching for different file types

6. ✅ Set up commitlint for message validation
   - Created `.commitlintrc.js` with conventional commit rules
   - Configured type enum and subject case validation

7. ✅ Configured pre-commit hooks for additional checks
   - Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
   - Added checks for trailing whitespace, file formatting
   - Integrated with ESLint and Prettier

8. ✅ Updated package.json scripts
   - Added lint, format, type-check scripts
   - Added test:affected for optimized testing
   - Added pre-commit and commitlint scripts

### Files Created/Modified:

- `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint configuration
- `.prettierrc` - Prettier configuration
- `.prettierignore` - Prettier ignore patterns
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit git hook
- `.husky/pre-push` - Pre-push git hook
- `.husky/commit-msg` - Commit message validation hook
- `lint-staged.config.js` - Lint-staged configuration
- `.commitlintrc.js` - Commitlint configuration
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit framework config
- `package.json` - Updated with new scripts and dependencies

### Testing:

- ✅ Tested Prettier formatting (formatted 534 files)
- ✅ Tested commit message validation (verified sentence-case enforcement)
- ✅ Verified Husky hooks are executable and functional

### Commit Information:

- Commit Hash: `8f1521e`
- Commit Message: `feat(E01-F02-T05): configure comprehensive code quality tools`

### Notes:

- All configurations are working as expected
- Pre-commit hooks will run automatically on git commits
- Team can use `--no-verify` flag in emergencies to bypass hooks
- May need to migrate to ESLint 9 flat config format in future
