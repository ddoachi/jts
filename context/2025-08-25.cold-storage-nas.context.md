3. **Enhanced NFS Mount Configuration** (Est: 30 min)

   - Update fstab with optimized NFS parameters
   - Remount with 1MB buffer configuration
   - Dependencies: Network optimization
   - Status: pending

4. **Directory Structure Creation** (Est: 25 min)

   - Create comprehensive directory hierarchy
   - Set proper ownership and permissions
   - Dependencies: NFS mount configuration
   - Status: pending

5. **Performance Testing** (Est: 30 min)

   - Benchmark write/read performance
   - Test concurrent access patterns
   - Dependencies: Directory structure
   - Status: pending

6. **Health Monitoring Script** (Est: 25 min)

   - Create comprehensive health check script
   - Implement connectivity and performance tests
   - Dependencies: Performance testing
   - Status: pending

7. **Integration Validation** (Est: 15 min)
   - Verify all acceptance criteria
   - Document integration points
   - Dependencies: All previous steps
   - Status: pending
