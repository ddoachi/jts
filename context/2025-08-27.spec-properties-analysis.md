# Spec File Properties Analysis & Recommendations

_Generated: 2025-08-27_
_Purpose: Architectural review of spec file properties for JTS trading system_

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the current spec file structure (e.g., @1011.md), the key recommendation is to replace ephemeral properties like `branch` with durable references such as `pull_requests` and `commits`. This improves long-term traceability and aligns with software development best practices.

## Property Categories

### 🔴 Essential Properties (Must Have)

These are fundamental to any specification system:

| Property   | Purpose                                | Why Essential                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `id`       | Unique numeric identifier              | Critical for references and cross-linking |
| `title`    | Human-readable name                    | Essential for communication               |
| `type`     | Spec category (epic/feature/task)      | Crucial for workflow management           |
| `status`   | Current state (draft/in-progress/done) | Essential for tracking                    |
| `parent`   | Parent spec ID                         | Critical for hierarchy                    |
| `children` | Child spec IDs                         | Necessary for decomposition               |
| `created`  | Creation date                          | Essential audit trail                     |
| `updated`  | Last modification                      | Critical for freshness                    |

### 🟡 High-Value Properties (Strongly Recommended)

Provide significant value for project management:

| Property          | Purpose             | Value Proposition          |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `priority`        | Task prioritization | Resource allocation        |
| `domain`          | Business area       | Team organization          |
| `estimated_hours` | Time estimate       | Sprint planning            |
| `actual_hours`    | Time spent          | Estimation improvement     |
| `effort`          | Size (S/M/L)        | Quick estimation           |
| `risk`            | Risk level          | Resource planning          |
| `tags`            | Searchable metadata | Discovery & categorization |
| `dependencies`    | Blocking specs      | Implementation sequencing  |
| `blocks`          | What this blocks    | Downstream impact          |
| `related`         | Related items       | Context & references       |

### 🟢 Nice-to-Have Properties (Optional)

Based on team-specific needs:

| Property   | Purpose             | When Useful              |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `assignee` | Current owner       | Multi-developer teams    |
| `reviewer` | Designated reviewer | Formal review process    |
| `due_date` | Target completion   | Deadline-driven projects |
| `files`    | Key files to modify | Scope understanding      |
| `worktree` | Git worktree path   | Complex branching        |

### ⚠️ Low-Value/Redundant Properties (Remove)

Should be reconsidered or removed:

| Property | Issue                                               | Better Alternative                |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `branch` | Ephemeral, often doesn't match final implementation | Use `pull_requests` and `commits` |

## 🚀 Suggested New Properties

### Enhanced Traceability

```yaml
# Replace branch with durable references
pull_requests: ['#19', '#23'] # GitHub PR numbers
commits: ['2da9f8d', '08e4cc5'] # Key commit hashes
deployment_tag: 'v1.2.3' # Release version
context_file: '1011.context.md' # Implementation journal
deliverables: # Generated artifacts
  ['scripts/setup.sh', 'docs/storage-guide.md']
```

### Quality & Validation

```yaml
test_coverage: 92 # Percentage coverage
acceptance_criteria: 8 # Total criteria
acceptance_met: 6 # Completed criteria
api_changes: false # Breaking changes flag
database_changes: true # Schema migrations
config_changes: ['redis.conf'] # Config modifications
```

### Enhanced Workflow

```yaml
technical_reviewer: 'alice' # Tech approval
product_reviewer: 'bob' # Business approval
qa_signoff: true # QA validation
performance_impact: 'positive' # Performance assessment
user_impact: 'medium' # End-user effect
rollback_tested: true # Rollback validated
```

## Recommended Minimal Property Set

For the JTS project, here's an optimized property set:

```yaml
# === CORE IDENTITY (Required) ===
id: '1011'
title: 'Hot Storage Setup'
type: 'task'
status: 'done'

# === HIERARCHY (Required) ===
parent: '1001'
children: []
epic: '1000'

# === TRACKING (Required) ===
created: '2025-08-24'
updated: '2025-08-27'

# === VALUE-ADD (Recommended) ===
priority: 'high'
domain: 'infrastructure'
estimated_hours: 2
actual_hours: 3
effort: 'small'
risk: 'low'
tags: ['storage', 'nvme', 'performance']

# === TRACEABILITY (New/Improved) ===
pull_requests: ['#19'] # Instead of branch
commits: ['2da9f8d', '08e4cc5'] # Implementation commits
context_file: '1011.context.md' # How it was built
deliverables: # What was produced
  ['scripts/setup-hot-directories.sh', 'docs/HOT_STORAGE_SETUP.md']

# === DEPENDENCIES ===
dependencies: []
blocks: ['1012', '1015']
related: ['1013', '1014']

# === QUALITY (Optional) ===
test_coverage: 95
acceptance_criteria: 8
acceptance_met: 8
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins

1. Remove `branch` property from new specs
2. Add `pull_requests` array to completed specs
3. Link to `context_file` for implementation details

### Phase 2: Enhanced Tracking

1. Add `commits` tracking for key changes
2. Implement `deliverables` registry
3. Add `test_coverage` metrics

### Phase 3: Automation

1. Script to populate `commits` from git history
2. GitHub API integration for `pull_requests`
3. Validation scripts for `deliverables`

## Key Principles

1. **Durability Over Convenience**: Permanent references (commits, PRs) > transient ones (branches)
2. **Bidirectional Traceability**: Every link should work both ways
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core properties standalone, extras add value
4. **Automation-Friendly**: Properties should be scriptable
5. **Tool Integration**: Work with Git, GitHub, IDEs, PM tools

## Conclusion

The current spec system is solid but can be improved by:

- Replacing `branch` with `pull_requests` and `commits`
- Adding `context_file` and `deliverables` tracking
- Including quality metrics (`test_coverage`, `acceptance_criteria`)
- Maintaining balance between completeness and maintenance overhead

These changes will significantly improve long-term project traceability while keeping the system maintainable.
