**Date**: 2025-08-26  
**ID**: broker-epic-feature-split  
**Status**: in_progress

## Original Prompt
- **Language**: english
- **Original**: "Using `software architect`, `system trading specialist` subagents, split @specs/2000-epic-broker-integration/2000-epic-broker-integration.spec.md into features, and save each spec files inside `@specs/2000-epic-broker-integration/`. Please refer to `@.claude-workflow/specs/spec.template.md` for the format of each spec file."
- **English**: Same as original
- **Polished**: "Split the broker integration epic specification into individual feature specifications using software architect and system trading specialist expertise, following the provided spec template format."

## Analysis
- **Complexity**: high
- **Estimated Duration**: 2 hours
- **Scope**: Create 11 feature specifications from the epic, each with detailed acceptance criteria, technical approach, and dependencies
