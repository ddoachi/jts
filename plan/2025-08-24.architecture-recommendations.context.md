**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**ID**: arch-recommendations-001  
**Status**: completed

## Original Prompt
- **Language**: english
- **Original**: "1. I want to implement as Web for Desktop using Next.js and Tailwindcss. Or what do you recommend? 2. For mobile page, which platform do you recommend? 3. For backend, I'm going to implement with Nest.js, how do you think? 4. For kafka, I'll install a new 4TB SSD, but I don't know how should I configure partitions in that 4TB SSD. This will be used for kafka, db, etc. Please recommend."
- **English**: Same as original
- **Polished**: "Provide comprehensive architecture recommendations for JTS trading platform including frontend framework selection, mobile platform strategy, backend architecture validation, and 4TB SSD partition configuration for data infrastructure"
