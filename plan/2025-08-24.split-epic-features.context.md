**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**ID**: epic-split-001  
**Status**: completed

## Original Prompt
- **Language**: english
- **Original**: "Using software architecture subagent, with reference @.claude-workflow/specs/spec.template.md , analyze @specs/1000-epic-foundation-infrastructure/1000-epic-foundation-infrastructure.spec.md , and split it into multiple features, and save their spec files into @specs/1000-epic-foundation-infrastructure/"
- **English**: "Using software architecture subagent, with reference @.claude-workflow/specs/spec.template.md , analyze @specs/1000-epic-foundation-infrastructure/1000-epic-foundation-infrastructure.spec.md , and split it into multiple features, and save their spec files into @specs/1000-epic-foundation-infrastructure/"
- **Polished**: "Analyze the foundation infrastructure epic specification and decompose it into multiple feature specifications following the established template format"

## Analysis
- **Complexity**: high
- **Estimated Duration**: 45-60 minutes
- **Scope**: Architectural analysis and specification decomposition of the foundation infrastructure epic into manageable feature specifications

## Implementation Plan
### Overview
This task involves analyzing the foundation infrastructure epic (ID: 1000) and breaking it down into multiple feature specifications. Each feature will be a cohesive set of related functionality that can be independently implemented while maintaining dependencies. The features will be numbered sequentially (1001, 1002, etc.) and follow the established specification template.

### Steps
1. **Read and Understand Templates** (Est: 5 min)
   - Read the spec template at .claude-workflow/specs/spec.template.md
   - Understand the structure and required sections
   - Dependencies: None
   - Status: pending

2. **Analyze Foundation Infrastructure Epic** (Est: 10 min)
   - Read the epic specification at specs/1000-epic-foundation-infrastructure/1000-epic-foundation-infrastructure.spec.md
   - Identify major components and themes
   - Dependencies: Step 1
   - Status: pending

3. **Design Feature Breakdown** (Est: 15 min)
   - Identify logical feature groups
   - Define feature boundaries and dependencies
   - Create feature numbering scheme (1001-1010)
   - Dependencies: Step 2
   - Status: pending

4. **Create Feature Specifications** (Est: 20 min)
   - Write detailed specifications for each feature
   - Follow the template format consistently
   - Include all required sections
   - Dependencies: Step 3
   - Status: pending

5. **Save Feature Files** (Est: 5 min)
   - Save each spec to specs/1000-epic-foundation-infrastructure/
   - Use naming pattern: {ID}-feature-{name}.spec.md
   - Dependencies: Step 4
   - Status: pending

6. **Validate and Review** (Est: 5 min)
   - Ensure all features cover the epic scope
   - Verify dependencies are clearly defined
   - Check for completeness
   - Dependencies: Step 5
   - Status: pending

- [ ] Create feature spec: Security Foundation (1008)
- [ ] Create feature spec: Testing Framework (1009)
- [ ] Create feature spec: Documentation System (1010)
- [ ] Save all feature specifications to designated directory
- [ ] Validate coverage and dependencies
