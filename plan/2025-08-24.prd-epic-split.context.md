**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**ID**: prd-epic-split-001  
**Status**: completed

## Original Prompt

- **Language**: english
- **Original**: "Please analyze `@prd.md`, and split it into multiple epics and save them into `./specs/`. Refer to `@.claude-workflow/specs/spec.template.md` for each spec template. And refer to `@plan/*.md` for detailed specification created from previous brainstorming with Claude Code."
- **English**: "Please analyze `@prd.md`, and split it into multiple epics and save them into `./specs/`. Refer to `@.claude-workflow/specs/spec.template.md` for each spec template. And refer to `@plan/*.md` for detailed specification created from previous brainstorming with Claude Code."
- **Polished**: "Analyze the Product Requirements Document and decompose it into well-structured epic specifications using the provided template, incorporating insights from existing planning documents"

## Analysis

- **Complexity**: high
- **Estimated Duration**: 45-60 minutes
- **Scope**: Create comprehensive epic specifications for the entire JTS system based on PRD analysis

## Implementation Plan

### Overview

Analyze the JTS PRD document to identify major functional domains and create structured epic specifications following the provided template. Each epic will be a self-contained unit of work representing a major system capability.

### Steps

1. **PRD Analysis & Epic Identification** (Est: 10 min)
   - Analyze PRD structure and content
   - Identify major functional domains
   - Map domains to epic boundaries
   - Dependencies: PRD document, plan files
   - Status: pending

2. **Epic Structure Planning** (Est: 5 min)
   - Define epic hierarchy and relationships
   - Establish numbering scheme (1000-series)
   - Plan folder structure
   - Dependencies: Template understanding
   - Status: pending

3. **Create Epic Specifications** (Est: 30 min)
   - Generate 10-12 epic specification files
   - Follow spec.template.md format
   - Include detailed acceptance criteria
   - Dependencies: Template, PRD content
   - Status: pending

4. **Validation & Cross-referencing** (Est: 10 min)
   - Validate epic completeness
   - Establish inter-epic dependencies
   - Update parent-child relationships
   - Dependencies: All epics created
   - Status: pending

### TODO Items

## Change History

_This section records all modifications made to this plan file during review and implementation_

### 2025-08-24 13:45:00 - Initial Plan Creation

- **Author**: Claude
- **Changes**: Created initial plan file with all sections
- **Reason**: User request for PRD epic splitting
- **Files Modified**: This plan file

### 2025-08-24 13:47:00 - Plan Refinement

- **Author**: Claude
- **Changes**: Removed numbering prefixes from epic IDs per template guidelines
