# Execution Context: Integrate Coordination Documentation and Create Mobile-Friendly Dependency Diagram

**Date**: 2025-08-25  
**ID**: integrate-coordination-docs  
**Status**: pending

## Original Prompt
- **Language**: english
- **Original**: "Please integrate @specs/1000-epic-foundation-infrastructure/1001-feature-storage-infrastructure/IMPLEMENTATION_COORDINATION.md  into @specs/1000-epic-foundation-infrastructure/1001-feature-storage-infrastructure/1001-feature-storage-infrastructure.spec.md 

And please draw the dependency diagram to be rendered vertically so that I can easily review it in my mobile device.

Please follow work process in /home/joohan/.claude/commands/run_command_with_context.md"
- **English**: Same as original
- **Polished**: "Integrate the implementation coordination documentation into the main storage infrastructure specification and redesign the dependency diagram with vertical layout for mobile device compatibility."

## Analysis
- **Complexity**: medium
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Scope**: Documentation integration, diagram redesign, mobile optimization

## Implementation Plan
### Overview
This task involves consolidating the storage infrastructure documentation by integrating the standalone coordination guide into the main specification file, and redesigning the dependency diagram for better mobile viewing experience with vertical layout.

### Steps
1. **Analyze Current Documentation Structure** (Est: 30 minutes)
   - Review existing coordination documentation content
   - Identify integration points in main spec
   - Plan content organization strategy
   - Dependencies: Access to both files
   - Status: pending

2. **Create Mobile-Optimized Dependency Diagram** (Est: 45 minutes)
   - Redesign existing horizontal diagram to vertical layout
   - Optimize for mobile screen dimensions
   - Ensure readability on small screens
   - Dependencies: Understanding of current dependencies
   - Status: pending

3. **Integrate Coordination Content** (Est: 60 minutes)
   - Merge coordination documentation into main spec
   - Organize content hierarchy logically
   - Remove duplications and conflicts
   - Update cross-references
   - Dependencies: Completed diagram redesign
   - Status: pending

4. **Clean Up and Validation** (Est: 30 minutes)
   - Remove standalone coordination file (if requested)
   - Validate all internal links and references
   - Ensure markdown formatting consistency
   - Test mobile rendering
   - Dependencies: Completed integration
   - Status: pending

### TODO Items
- [ ] Analyze and map content from IMPLEMENTATION_COORDINATION.md
- [ ] Redesign dependency diagram for vertical/mobile layout
- [ ] Integrate coordination sections into main spec file
- [ ] Update section hierarchy and organization
- [ ] Remove duplicate content and resolve conflicts
- [ ] Update all cross-references and links
- [ ] Validate markdown formatting and mobile compatibility
- [ ] Clean up any redundant files
- [ ] Test final documentation structure

## Execution Log
*This section tracks every implementation step in chronological order*

### 2025-08-25T07:20:00Z - Step 1: Analyze Current Documentation Structure
- **Action**: Reviewed IMPLEMENTATION_COORDINATION.md (335 lines) and main spec (1160 lines) to understand content overlap and integration strategy
- **Files Reviewed**: IMPLEMENTATION_COORDINATION.md, 1001-feature-storage-infrastructure.spec.md
- **Result**: success
- **Analysis Findings**:
  - Coordination doc has detailed parallel execution strategy (not in main spec)
  - Current dependency diagram is horizontal Mermaid format  
  - Main spec contains some overlapping content but lacks detailed coordination sections
  - Integration points identified: Task Dependencies, Implementation Phases, Parallel Execution, Risk Management
- **Build Status**: skipped (analysis step)
- **Commit**: pending
- **Notes**: Ready to proceed with diagram redesign and integration
- **Duration**: 20 minutes
