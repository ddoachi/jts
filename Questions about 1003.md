1. Why `brokres` and `domain` exist in `libs/` ? 
2. In `#### System Architecture Layers`, `Market Data Collector` and `Notification Service` belong to `Integration Layer`, but in `Workspace Structure`, they exist in `apps/`. Is it fine?
3. In `Workspace Structure` there is not `src/`. Already there are so many folders in the project root, like `specs`, `context`, etc., isn't it confusing?
