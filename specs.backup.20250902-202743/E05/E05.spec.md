# Risk Management System

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive risk management system that protects capital through intelligent position sizing, portfolio-level risk controls, and real-time monitoring. This epic includes advanced risk models, correlation analysis, volatility-adjusted position sizing, and emergency stop mechanisms to ensure trading operations remain within acceptable risk parameters.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real-time position sizing using Kelly Criterion and volatility adjustment
- [ ] Multi-level risk limits (per symbol, sector, portfolio, daily)
- [ ] Correlation-based exposure management across positions
- [ ] Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculation and monitoring
- [ ] Emergency stop-all functionality with <100ms response time
- [ ] Dynamic risk adjustment based on market conditions
- [ ] Portfolio heat map visualization for risk exposure
- [ ] Drawdown protection with automatic position reduction
- [ ] Risk alerts and notifications system
- [ ] Comprehensive risk reporting and audit trail

## Technical Approach

### Risk Management Architecture

Create a multi-layered risk management system that operates in real-time, evaluating risk at multiple levels from individual positions to overall portfolio exposure, with the ability to halt trading instantly when limits are breached.

### Key Components

1. **Position Sizing Engine**
   - Kelly Criterion implementation
   - Volatility-adjusted sizing
   - Account balance consideration
   - Risk budget allocation
   - Dynamic sizing based on confidence

2. **Risk Limit Framework**
   - Per-symbol position limits
   - Daily loss limits per account
   - Sector exposure limits
   - Correlation-based limits
   - Portfolio maximum drawdown

3. **Real-time Risk Monitor**
   - Continuous P&L tracking
   - Mark-to-market valuation
   - Risk metric calculation
   - Limit breach detection
   - Emergency stop triggers

4. **Portfolio Risk Analytics**
   - Correlation matrix calculation
   - Sector exposure analysis
   - Value-at-Risk modeling
   - Stress testing scenarios
   - Performance attribution

5. **Emergency Controls**
   - Instant stop-all trading
   - Position liquidation logic
   - Circuit breaker patterns
   - Manual override capabilities
   - Recovery procedures

### Implementation Steps

1. **Design Risk Models**
   - Define risk metrics and formulas
   - Create position sizing algorithms
   - Design limit structures
   - Plan emergency procedures

2. **Build Position Sizing Engine**
   - Implement Kelly Criterion
   - Add volatility adjustments
   - Create risk budget system
   - Build sizing validation

3. **Implement Risk Limits**
   - Create limit configuration system
   - Build real-time monitoring
   - Add breach detection logic
   - Implement alert system

4. **Develop Risk Analytics**
   - Build correlation engine
   - Implement VaR calculation
   - Create stress testing
   - Add portfolio analysis

5. **Create Emergency Systems**
   - Build stop-all mechanism
   - Implement circuit breakers
   - Add manual controls
   - Create recovery procedures

6. **Build Risk Dashboard**
   - Create real-time visualizations
   - Add risk heat maps
   - Implement alert interface
   - Build reporting tools

## Dependencies

- **E01**: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup - Requires Redis for real-time state management
- **E02**: Multi-Broker Integration Layer - Needs broker connections for position queries
- **E03**: Market Data Collection & Processing - Requires real-time pricing for mark-to-market
- **E04**: Trading Strategy Engine & DSL - Needs strategy signals for position sizing decisions

## Testing Plan

- Position sizing algorithm validation tests
- Risk limit enforcement stress tests
- Emergency stop mechanism response time tests
- Correlation calculation accuracy tests
- VaR model backtesting validation
- Portfolio risk scenario testing
- System failure and recovery tests

## Claude Code Instructions

```
When implementing this epic:
1. Use TypeScript with strict typing for all risk calculations
2. Implement real-time risk monitoring with <10ms calculation latency
3. Store all risk events in PostgreSQL for audit trail
4. Use Redis for real-time risk state caching
5. Implement comprehensive logging for all risk decisions
6. Create configurable risk parameters via environment variables
7. Use event-driven architecture for risk alerts
8. Implement proper error handling for risk calculation failures
9. Create detailed unit tests for all risk formulas
10. Use mathematical libraries for statistical calculations
```

## Notes

- Risk management is critical - failures can result in significant losses
- All risk calculations must be mathematically sound and tested
- Emergency stops must be failsafe and tested regularly
- Consider implementing machine learning for dynamic risk adjustment
- Risk parameters should be configurable without code changes
