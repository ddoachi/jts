# Context: E01-F01-T06 (Tiered Storage Management)

## Spec Information

- **ID**: 08fe2621
- **Title**: Tiered Storage Management
- **Epic**: E01
- **Feature**: F01
- **Task**: T06

## Overall Objective

The JTS trading system requires a sophisticated three-tier storage architecture to handle different data lifecycle stages efficiently. This implementation provides automated management for the entire storage ecosystem, ensuring optimal performance, cost-effectiveness, and operational reliability.

### Business Problem Solved

- **Performance**: Active trading data needs ultra-fast access (Hot tier - NVMe)
- **Cost Optimization**: Historical data can use cheaper storage (Warm/Cold tiers)
- **Operational Efficiency**: Manual storage management is error-prone and time-consuming
- **Data Safety**: Multi-tier backup strategy ensures data protection across failure scenarios
- **Compliance**: Automated archival helps meet data retention requirements

### Storage Tier Strategy

1. **Hot Tier (NVMe)**: Real-time trading data, active databases, current logs
2. **Warm Tier (SATA)**: Recent backups, processed data, compressed logs
3. **Cold Tier (NAS)**: Long-term archives, historical data, configuration backups

### Why Automation is Critical

- **24/7 Operation**: Trading systems can't afford manual maintenance windows
- **Data Growth**: Market data grows exponentially, requiring constant management
- **Human Error Prevention**: Automated policies eliminate manual mistakes
- **Consistent Operations**: Same procedures executed reliably every time
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Issues detected before they impact trading operations

## Detailed Component Analysis

### Script 1: `storage-health.sh` - Multi-Tier Health Monitoring

**Purpose**: Provides unified visibility into the health and capacity of all three storage tiers.

**Why Needed**:

- **Proactive Monitoring**: Detect capacity issues before they cause outages
- **Unified View**: Single command shows status of all tiers instead of checking each manually
- **Alert Generation**: Automated warnings at 80% and critical alerts at 90% usage
- **Network Validation**: Ensures NAS connectivity is working for archival operations

**Key Functionality**:

- LVM status checking for hot tier (if available)
- Filesystem usage monitoring for warm tier
- NAS connectivity validation with ping tests
- Color-coded output with emojis for quick visual assessment
- Graceful handling when tiers are unavailable

**Operational Value**: Enables operations team to quickly assess storage health and take preventive action before capacity issues impact trading.

### Script 2: `tiered-storage.sh` - Automated Data Movement

**Purpose**: Implements intelligent data lifecycle management by automatically moving data between tiers based on age and access patterns.

**Why Needed**:

- **Cost Optimization**: Keeps fast storage free for active data
- **Performance Maintenance**: Prevents hot tier from filling up and slowing down
- **Automated Hygiene**: Removes old temporary files and unused Docker resources
- **Operational Efficiency**: Eliminates manual data movement tasks

**Data Movement Logic**:

- **Logs**: Move files older than 7 days from `/var/log` to warm storage with compression
- **Backups**: Archive backups older than 30 days from warm to cold storage
- **Temp Files**: Clean up processing files older than 3 days
- **Docker Cleanup**: Remove unused containers, images, and build cache

**Risk Mitigation**: Only moves data when destination tiers are available, preventing data loss.

### Script 3: `nas-archival.sh` - Long-Term Data Preservation

**Purpose**: Manages long-term archival of development resources and system configurations to NAS storage.

**Why Needed**:

- **Disaster Recovery**: Critical configurations backed up off-site
- **Development Continuity**: Jupyter notebooks and datasets preserved
- **Compliance**: Historical data retained according to policies
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Development work protected from local failures

**Archival Strategy**:

- **Incremental Sync**: Uses rsync for efficient bandwidth usage
- **Timestamped Backups**: Configuration snapshots with date stamps for versioning
- **Selective Sync**: Only backs up relevant directories to avoid clutter

**Business Continuity**: Enables rapid recovery of development environment and critical system configurations.

### Script 4: `lvm-backup.sh` - Database Snapshot Management

**Purpose**: Creates and manages LVM snapshots for database consistency and point-in-time recovery.

**Why Needed**:

- **Data Integrity**: Consistent snapshots of running databases
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Ability to restore to specific moments
- **Low Impact**: Snapshots create minimal disruption to trading operations
- **Space Management**: Automatic cleanup prevents snapshot accumulation

**Database Coverage**:

- **PostgreSQL** (5GB snapshots): User accounts, orders, trading records
- **ClickHouse** (10GB snapshots): Market data, trading analytics
- **MongoDB** (2GB snapshots): Configuration data, strategies

**Recovery Benefits**: Provides rapid recovery options without stopping trading operations.

### Systemd Integration: `tiered-storage.{service,timer}`

**Purpose**: Ensures reliable daily execution of storage management tasks without manual intervention.

**Why Needed**:

- **Consistency**: Same operations run every day at optimal times
- **Reliability**: systemd ensures execution even after reboots
- **Logging**: Journal captures all operations for audit and troubleshooting
- **Resource Management**: Runs as oneshot service to avoid resource conflicts

**Operational Benefits**:

- Runs during low-activity periods (typically early morning)
- Persistent scheduling survives system restarts
- Easy monitoring via `journalctl`
- Can be manually triggered for emergency cleanup

## System Architecture Integration

This tiered storage management integrates with the broader JTS infrastructure:

- **Dependencies**: Requires T03 (Warm Storage) and T04 (NAS Integration) to be operational
- **Database Integration**: Works with existing PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, and MongoDB instances
- **Monitoring Integration**: Provides data for broader system monitoring dashboards
- **Backup Strategy**: Coordinates with database-specific backup procedures
- **Trading Impact**: Scheduled to minimize impact on trading operations

## Technical Decisions and Rationale

### Design Principles Applied

1. **Fail-Safe Operations**: All scripts check for tier availability before attempting operations
   - **Rationale**: Trading systems cannot afford data loss due to failed storage operations
   - **Implementation**: Extensive `if` checks and error handling in all scripts

2. **Idempotent Operations**: Scripts can be run multiple times safely
   - **Rationale**: Automation may retry operations, scripts must handle reruns gracefully
   - **Implementation**: Check for existing conditions before creating/moving data

3. **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations logged with clear status messages
   - **Rationale**: Operations team needs visibility into automated processes
   - **Implementation**: Echo statements with emojis and clear success/warning messages

4. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating even when some tiers are unavailable
   - **Rationale**: Partial functionality is better than complete failure
   - **Implementation**: Skip operations for unavailable tiers, continue with available ones

### Architecture Choices

- **Bash Scripts vs Python/Node.js**: Chose bash for simplicity and universal availability
- **Systemd vs Cron**: Selected systemd for better logging and reliability
- **File-based vs Database Configuration**: Used embedded configuration for portability
- **Separate Scripts vs Monolith**: Modular approach allows selective execution and easier testing

### Performance Considerations

- **I/O Optimization**: Use rsync for efficient data transfer
- **Scheduling**: Run during low-activity periods to minimize trading impact
- **Resource Management**: oneshot systemd services prevent resource conflicts
- **Compression**: Automatic gzip compression reduces storage requirements

## Lessons Learned During Implementation

### Technical Insights

- **LVM Availability**: Not all environments have LVM configured - graceful handling essential
- **NAS Reliability**: Network storage requires connectivity validation before operations
- **Docker Cleanup Impact**: Aggressive cleanup can reclaim significant space (44GB in testing)
- **Error Handling Complexity**: More time spent on error cases than happy path

### Operational Insights

- **Testing Importance**: Real-world testing revealed edge cases not considered in design
