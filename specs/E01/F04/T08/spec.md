# Performance Testing Workflow

## Overview

Implement automated performance testing workflows using k6 for API load testing and Lighthouse for frontend performance audits to ensure the trading system meets performance requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Load Testing**: k6 scripts for API endpoints
- [ ] **Performance Budgets**: Response time thresholds
- [ ] **Stress Testing**: System breaking point detection
- [ ] **Frontend Audits**: Lighthouse CI integration
- [ ] **Scheduled Runs**: Daily performance checks
- [ ] **Trend Analysis**: Performance over time tracking
- [ ] **Alert Thresholds**: Performance degradation alerts
- [ ] **Report Storage**: Historical performance data

## Key Implementation Details

- k6 for API load testing
- Lighthouse for web performance
- Grafana Cloud for metrics storage
- Performance regression detection
- Automated performance reports
- Integration with monitoring stack
