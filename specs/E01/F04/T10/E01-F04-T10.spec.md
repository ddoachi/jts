# Branch Protection and Quality Gates

## Overview

Implement comprehensive GitHub branch protection rules and quality gates for a financial trading system to ensure regulatory compliance, security, and code quality. This specification defines multi-layered protection mechanisms that enforce strict security controls, comprehensive testing, and compliance auditing before allowing changes to production and staging branches.

## Financial Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Framework
- **SOX Compliance**: Segregation of duties, change control documentation
- **GDPR/Data Protection**: Privacy impact assessment for data handling changes
- **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)**: Audit trails, risk management controls
- **MiFID II**: Transaction reporting accuracy, system resilience
- **CFTC/SEC**: Market data integrity, algorithmic trading controls

### Audit Requirements
- All branch protection changes must be logged and auditable
- Change approvals must be traceable to named individuals
- Emergency overrides require executive approval and incident documentation
- Quarterly compliance reviews of branch protection effectiveness

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Branch Protection
- [ ] **Production Branch (main)**: Maximum security protection
  - [ ] Require 3+ approvals from different teams (trading, risk, compliance)
  - [ ] Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
  - [ ] Require up-to-date branches before merge
  - [ ] Restrict force pushes and deletions
  - [ ] Require signed commits
  - [ ] Include administrators in restrictions
- [ ] **Staging Branch (develop)**: Moderate protection
  - [ ] Require 2+ approvals with at least one from security team
  - [ ] Allow squash and merge only
  - [ ] Require conversation resolution
- [ ] **Feature Branches**: Basic protection with quality gates
  - [ ] Require 1+ approval
  - [ ] All status checks must pass
- [ ] **Hotfix Branches**: Emergency procedures with audit trail
  - [ ] Expedited approval process (1 senior developer + 1 compliance officer)
  - [ ] Mandatory post-deployment security scan
  - [ ] Automated incident documentation

### CODEOWNERS Configuration
- [ ] **Critical Trading Components**: Algo team + Risk team mandatory
  - [ ] Strategy engine algorithms
  - [ ] Order execution logic
  - [ ] Risk management systems
  - [ ] Position calculation modules
- [ ] **Security-Sensitive Areas**: Security team + Compliance mandatory

### Automated Compliance Checks
```yaml
# GitHub Action for compliance validation
name: Compliance Validation
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
jobs:
  validate-compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Audit Trail Check
        run: |
          # Validate change documentation
          # Check for proper ticket references
          # Verify business justification
      
      - name: Data Privacy Impact Assessment
        run: |
          # Scan for PII handling changes
          # Validate GDPR compliance
          # Check data retention policies
      
      - name: Algorithm Validation
        if: contains(github.event.pull_request.changed_files, 'strategy-engine')
        run: |
          # Validate trading algorithm changes
          # Check risk parameters
          # Verify backtesting results
```

### Merge Strategy Configuration
- **Production (main)**: Squash and merge only
  - Maintains clean commit history
  - Simplifies rollback procedures
  - Facilitates audit trail analysis
- **Staging (develop)**: Squash or rebase allowed
  - Preserves feature development context
  - Enables bisecting for issue diagnosis
- **Feature branches**: All merge types allowed
  - Developer flexibility for experimentation
  - Cleanup before merging to staging

### Security Integration Points
- **Identity Provider Integration**: SAML/OIDC with MFA required
- **Privileged Access Management**: Integration with PAM solution
- **Security Information and Event Management**: Real-time logging
- **Vulnerability Management**: Automated ticket creation for findings

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **False Positive Security Scans**: Allowlist mechanism with approval workflow
- **CI/CD Pipeline Failures**: Partial failure handling with manual override capability
- **Performance Test Instability**: Multiple runs with statistical significance testing
- **Dependency Update Conflicts**: Automated vulnerability patching with testing

### Operational Risks
- **Key Personnel Unavailability**: Cross-training and backup approvers
- **Emergency Deployment Needs**: Pre-approved emergency contact procedures
- **Regulatory Deadline Pressure**: Compliance team involvement in sprint planning
- **Third-party Integration Issues**: Vendor SLA enforcement and backup procedures

### Compliance Risks
- **Audit Finding Remediation**: Mandatory timeline tracking and escalation
- **Regulatory Change Impact**: Quarterly regulation review and adaptation
- **Data Privacy Violations**: Automated PII detection and classification
- **Algorithm Bias Detection**: Regular model validation and bias testing
