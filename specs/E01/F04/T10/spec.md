# Branch Protection and Quality Gates

## Overview

Configure GitHub branch protection rules and quality gates to enforce code review, testing, and security requirements before merging to protected branches.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Protected Branches**: Main and develop protection
- [ ] **Required Checks**: CI must pass before merge
- [ ] **Code Reviews**: Minimum 2 approvals required
- [ ] **Dismiss Stale Reviews**: Re-review on changes
- [ ] **Code Owners**: Automatic review assignment
- [ ] **Linear History**: Enforce squash or rebase
- [ ] **Quality Gates**: Coverage and security thresholds
- [ ] **Admin Restrictions**: Enforce rules for admins

## Key Implementation Details

- GitHub branch protection API configuration
- CODEOWNERS file for automatic reviews
- Required status checks configuration
- Merge strategy enforcement
- Protection rule automation scripts
- Emergency override procedures
