## GitHub Issue

- Issue: [Issue#140 E01-F04-T04: Deployment Pipeline Workflows](https://github.com/ddoachi/jts/issues/140)
- Created: 2025-09-06

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Pre-Implementation

- ✅ Created GitHub issue #140
- ✅ Reviewed existing deployment workflows
- ✅ Analyzed E01-F04-T01 context for CI error patterns
- ✅ Planned deployment strategy for three environments

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### 1. Development Deployment Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml`

Enhanced with CI error fixes from E01-F04-T01:
- Docker Compose V2 syntax (`docker compose` not `docker-compose`)
- Correct PostgreSQL port 5442 from docker-compose.dev.yml
- Consistent yarn usage throughout (replaced npm commands)
- Robust Nx cache cleanup: `rm -rf .nx/cache || true`
- Integration testing with local Docker services
- Comprehensive health checks with retry logic
- Automatic rollback on deployment failure
- Enhanced notifications with job status details

**Key Features Added**:
- Docker Compose integration for local services testing
- Exponential backoff retry patterns
- Conditional E2E test execution with project checking
- 60-second minimum service startup delays
- Continue-on-error for conditional operations

#### 2. Staging Deployment Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`

Production-grade blue-green deployment with:
- Progressive canary traffic switching (10% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%)
- Circuit breaker with performance thresholds
- Error rate monitoring with 1% threshold auto-rollback
- Database migration safety validation
- Zero-downtime guarantee verification
- Extended health check delays (90 seconds)
- Robust script existence checking with fallbacks

**Advanced Features**:
- Statistical performance analysis (5-request sampling)
- Real-time monitoring with progress indicators
- Database transaction safety validation
- Instant rollback capability verification
- Success rate threshold: 80%
- Response time threshold: 500ms

#### 3. Production Deployment Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`

Enterprise-grade deployment with:
- Multi-stage approval gates (team lead + security review)
- Pre-deployment security scanning with Trivy
- Progressive canary rollout (5% → 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Trading system-specific health validation
- Emergency rollback capability (<2 minute recovery)
- Multi-channel notifications (Slack, Teams, Email)

**Production-Specific Features**:
- Error rate threshold: 0.5%
- P95 latency threshold: 200ms
- Success rate minimum: 99.5%
- Trading anomaly detection
- Extended artifact retention (30 days)
- Comprehensive audit trail
- Database backup with S3 storage
- Multi-database support (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, MongoDB)

#### 4. Emergency Rollback Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/rollback-emergency.yml`

Rapid recovery mechanism with:
- <2 minute rollback time for all environments
- Environment-specific rollback strategies
- Severity assessment (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Trading system safety validation
- Multi-channel emergency notifications
- Incident report generation (90-day retention)
- Skip validation option for critical emergencies
- PagerDuty escalation for CRITICAL issues

**Rollback Strategies**:
- Production: Blue-green instant switch with trading validation
- Staging: Blue-green service selector switch
- Development: Kubernetes rollout undo

#### 5. Deployment Validation Scripts

**Script 1**: `scripts/deployment/validate-deployment.sh`

Comprehensive validation including:
- Kubernetes deployment validation
- Blue-green environment checks
- Health endpoint validation
- Performance metrics validation
- Database connectivity checks
- Trading system validation (production only)
- Environment-specific thresholds
- Timeout protection (300s default)

**Script 2**: `scripts/deployment/migration-safety-check.sh`

Database migration safety with:
- Pending migration analysis
- Dangerous operation detection
- Active connection monitoring
- Automated backup creation
- Migration simulation (dry-run mode)
- Rollback plan generation
- Multi-database support
- S3 backup integration

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation

#### Workflow Validation

All workflows validated for:
- YAML syntax correctness
- GitHub Actions compatibility
- Environment variable usage
- Secret references
- Job dependencies
- Conditional logic

#### CI Error Fixes Applied

From E01-F04-T01 context:

1. **Docker Compose V2** (Error #2)
   - All workflows use `docker compose` syntax
   - Correct path: `configs/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml`

2. **Package Manager Consistency** (Error #12)
   - All workflows use `yarn` consistently
   - No mixed `npm`/`yarn` usage

3. **Nx Command Syntax** (Error #10)
   - Modern syntax: `nx show projects --affected`
   - Proper output formatting for GitHub Actions

4. **Script Existence Checks** (Error #4)
   - Validation before execution
   - Fallback strategies for missing scripts

5. **Port Configuration** (Error #5)
   - PostgreSQL dev port: 5442
   - Proper health check endpoints

6. **Multiline Output Handling** (Error #9)
   - Convert to single-line for GitHub Actions
   - Proper GITHUB_OUTPUT formatting

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

- **Development**: Simple deployment with rollback capability
- **Staging**: Full blue-green with traffic switching
- **Production**: Blue-green with progressive canary rollout

### 2. Health Check Strategy

- **Startup Delays**: 60s (dev), 90s (staging), 120s (production)
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable attempts
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic rollback on threshold violations

### 3. Monitoring Integration

- **Metrics Collection**: Response time, error rate, success rate
- **Thresholds**: Environment-specific SLA compliance
- **Alerting**: Multi-channel notifications with severity levels

### 4. Security Measures

- **Approval Gates**: Multi-stage for production
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy integration with SARIF upload
- **Secret Management**: GitHub Secrets with Kubernetes integration
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and artifact retention

## Lessons Learned

### From E01-F04-T01 Context

1. **Docker Compose V2 is mandatory** - GitHub Actions runners updated
2. **Script existence must be validated** - Prevents workflow failures
3. **Port configurations vary by environment** - Dev uses different ports
4. **Multiline output breaks GitHub Actions** - Must convert to single-line
5. **Health checks need adequate delays** - Services need time to stabilize

### From Current Implementation

1. **Progressive rollouts reduce risk** - Gradual traffic switching catches issues early
2. **Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures** - Automatic rollback on anomalies
3. **Multiple approval gates add security** - But must balance with deployment velocity
4. **Comprehensive monitoring is essential** - Real-time metrics drive decisions
5. **Emergency procedures must be tested** - Regular drills ensure readiness

## Next Steps

1. Configure GitHub repository secrets:
   - `PROD_KUBECONFIG`
   - `STAGING_KUBECONFIG`
   - `DEV_KUBECONFIG`
   - Database credentials for each environment
   - Notification webhooks (Slack, Teams, PagerDuty)

2. Set up GitHub environments:
   - `development`
   - `staging`
   - `staging-approval`
   - `production`
   - `production-approval`
   - `production-emergency`

3. Create Kubernetes manifests:
   - Blue-green deployment configurations
   - Service definitions with selectors
   - Ingress rules for traffic management

4. Configure monitoring:
   - Prometheus metrics endpoints
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Alert rules

5. Test deployment pipelines:
   - Dry-run migrations
