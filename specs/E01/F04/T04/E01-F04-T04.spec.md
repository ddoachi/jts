# Deployment Pipeline Workflows

## Overview

Create environment-specific deployment workflows implementing blue-green deployment strategy with automated rollback capabilities for development, staging, and production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Environment Workflows**: Separate workflows for dev, staging, production
- [ ] **Blue-Green Strategy**: Zero-downtime deployments
- [ ] **Database Migrations**: Automated migration execution
- [ ] **Health Checks**: Pre and post deployment validation
- [ ] **Rollback Mechanism**: Automatic rollback on failure
- [ ] **Approval Gates**: Manual approval for production
- [ ] **Smoke Tests**: Post-deployment validation
- [ ] **Monitoring Integration**: Deployment metrics and alerts
