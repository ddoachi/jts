## Implementation Timeline

### 2025-09-02 20:29: Context Created

- Created context documentation
- Added verification requirements

### 2025-01-03: Discussion - Task Dependency Analysis

**Type**: Discussion
**Command**: `/spec_work E01-F04 --discussion "Analyze dependencies between tasks inside E01-F04, find tasks to be processed in parallel"`

**Actions Taken**:
1. **Used Software Architect Agent** to analyze task dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
   - Analyzed all 11 tasks for dependencies
   - Identified critical path through the project
   - Created optimal parallel execution strategy

2. **Updated E01-F04.spec.md** with comprehensive dependency analysis:
   - Added "Task Dependencies and Parallel Execution Strategy" section
   - Created dependency matrix showing task relationships
   - Added Gantt chart for parallel execution phases (Mermaid diagram)
   - Documented critical path visualization
   - Added resource allocation recommendations

3. **Key Findings**:
   - Reduced execution time from 21 hours (sequential) to 11 hours (parallel)
   - 47% time savings through parallelization
   - Critical path identified: T01/T06 → T07 → T02 → T04
   - Organized into 4 execution phases with parallel tasks:
     - Phase 1 (0-2h): T01, T05, T06 in parallel
     - Phase 2 (2-5h): T07, T03, T09, T10 in parallel
     - Phase 3 (5-8h): T02, T08 in parallel
     - Phase 4 (8-11h): T04, T11 in parallel

**Commits**:
- `400dd18` - docs(specs): Add task dependency analysis and parallel execution strategy for E01-F04

## Verification Documentation

### How to Verify Implementation

#### 1. Setup Requirements
```bash
# Environment setup
cd /path/to/project
npm install
```

#### 2. Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific tests
npm test -- --grep "E01-F04"
```

#### 3. Manual Verification Steps
1. **Setup**: Initialize the environment
   - Expected: All dependencies installed
   - Verify: `npm list`

2. **Execution**: Run the implementation
   - Expected: Successful execution
   - Verify: Check logs for success messages

#### 4. Expected Outputs
```
Implementation completed successfully
All tests passing
No errors in console
```
