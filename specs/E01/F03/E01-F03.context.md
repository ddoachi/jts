## Implementation Timeline

### Session 1: 2025-08-28 - Task Breakdown

**Action**: Split feature into tasks  
**Method**: Software architect analysis  
**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Created Specs**:

- [Task T01: Initialize Nx Workspace with Base Configuration](T01.md) - 2 hours
- [Task T02: Configure Shared Libraries Infrastructure](T02.md) - 3 hours
- [Task T03: Set Up Build and Testing Infrastructure](T03.md) - 2.5 hours
- [Task T04: Implement TypeScript Configuration and Linting](T04.md) - 2 hours
- [Task T05: Create Development Tooling and Generators](T05.md) - 2.5 hours
- [Task T06: Configure CI/CD Pipeline and Automation](T06.md) - 2 hours

**Rationale**:

- Each task represents a logical, self-contained component
- Tasks build upon each other with clear dependencies
- Total estimated time: 14 hours
- Parallel execution possible for tasks 3 & 4 after task 2

**Key Decisions**:

1. Nx 17+ for advanced monorepo capabilities
2. Strict TypeScript configuration for type safety
3. Jest with 95% coverage threshold for quality assurance
4. Custom generators for consistent service creation
5. GitHub Actions with affected builds for efficiency
