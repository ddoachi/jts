# Implementation Context for E01-F03-T03: Set Up Build and Testing Infrastructure

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation progress of setting up build and testing infrastructure for the JTS project.

## GitHub Issue

- Issue #69: [E01-F03-T03] Set Up Build and Testing Infrastructure
- Link: https://github.com/ddoachi/jts/issues/69

## Implementation Timeline

### 2025-09-01: Initial Implementation

#### 1. Created GitHub Issue

- Created issue #69 to track the implementation
- Added comprehensive acceptance criteria and technical details

#### 2. Configured Jest with Coverage

- **File**: `jest.config.ts`
- Set up comprehensive Jest configuration with 95% coverage thresholds
- Added SWC transformer for faster TypeScript compilation
- Configured coverage collection rules and reporters
- Set up test matching patterns and module name mapping
- Enabled parallel test execution with 50% max workers
- **Commit**: `07faef1` - feat(testing): configure Jest with 95% coverage threshold

#### 3. Enhanced Jest Preset

- **File**: `jest.preset.js`
- Added coverage reporters (text, html, cobertura)
- Set test timeout to 10 seconds
- Enabled automatic mock clearing and restoration
- **Commit**: `07faef1` - feat(testing): configure Jest with 95% coverage threshold

#### 4. Created Test Utilities

- **File**: `tools/test-setup.ts`
- Created comprehensive test setup with global utilities
- Added mock factories for common services:
  - Repository mocks with QueryBuilder support
  - Redis mock with all common operations
  - Kafka Producer/Consumer mocks
  - HTTP Service mock
  - Config Service mock
- Added utility functions:
  - `createMockService` - Creates mocked service instances
  - `expectToThrowWithMessage` - Enhanced error testing
  - `createTestModule` - NestJS test module factory
  - `waitFor` - Async condition waiting
  - `mockDate` - Date mocking utilities
  - `delay` - Simple delay function
- **Commit**: `9f117df` - feat(testing): create comprehensive test utilities and setup

#### 5. Optimized Build Configuration

- **File**: `nx.json`
- Added build target options for outputPath, main, and tsConfig
- Configured test target with passWithNoTests and CI configuration
- Added coverage reporting configuration for CI mode
- Included sharedGlobals for better caching
- Excluded storybook files from production inputs
- **Commit**: `72363cc` - feat(build): optimize Nx build configuration with caching

#### 6. Implemented Dependency Boundary Enforcement

- **File**: `.eslintrc.nx.json`
- Created ESLint configuration for Nx module boundaries
- Defined dependency constraints between different scopes:
  - `scope:shared` - Can only depend on shared
  - `scope:domain` - Can depend on shared and domain
  - `scope:infrastructure` - Can depend on shared, domain, and infrastructure
  - `scope:brokers` - Can depend on shared, domain, and infrastructure
  - `scope:apps` - Can depend on any libraries
- Enforced buildable lib dependencies
- **Commit**: `9f879cc` - feat(quality): implement dependency boundary enforcement

#### 7. Installed Required Dependencies

- **Files**: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- Added @swc/jest and @swc/core as dev dependencies
- Enabled faster test execution with SWC transformer
- **Commit**: `7dca3a1` - feat(testing): install SWC for faster Jest TypeScript compilation

## Verification Results

### Test Execution

- Successfully ran tests for `shared-utils` library
- Coverage reporting working correctly (100% coverage achieved for test file)
- Parallel test execution configured and operational

### Build System

- Build targets successfully compile TypeScript files
- Caching configuration applied and working
- Named inputs properly configured for optimization

### Dependency Boundaries

- ESLint configuration created for module boundary enforcement
- Existing project.json files already have proper tags configured
- Hierarchical dependency rules established

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files

1. `tools/test-setup.ts` - Comprehensive test utilities and setup
2. `.eslintrc.nx.json` - ESLint configuration for Nx module boundaries

### Modified Files

1. `jest.config.ts` - Enhanced with coverage and performance settings
2. `jest.preset.js` - Added reporters and test configuration
3. `nx.json` - Optimized build and test configurations
4. `package.json` - Added SWC dependencies
5. `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependencies

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- ✅ Jest configured with 95% coverage threshold
- ✅ Build targets optimized with caching
- ✅ Parallel test execution enabled
- ✅ Coverage reporting integrated
- ✅ Test utilities and common setup configured
- ✅ Dependency boundaries enforced

## Next Steps

1. Monitor test execution performance across the monorepo
2. Fine-tune coverage thresholds based on project needs
3. Add more specialized test utilities as needed
4. Consider adding pre-commit hooks for test execution

## Notes

- SWC transformer significantly improves test compilation speed
- Module boundary enforcement helps maintain clean architecture
- Test utilities provide consistent mocking patterns across the codebase
- Coverage thresholds set at 95% ensure high code quality standards
