- âœ… Samsung SSD 990 PRO 1TB (nvme1n1)
- âœ… Samsung SSD 860 EVO 1TB (sda) warm storage
- âœ… All devices properly detected and optimized

### Production Readiness

#### Installation Process

1. Copy configuration files to system locations
2. Enable systemd timer for automated maintenance
3. Verify optimization status with monitoring scripts
4. Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure

#### Maintenance Requirements

- **Daily**: Monitor via existing system monitoring
- **Weekly**: Automated TRIM operations (configured)
- **Monthly**: Full performance benchmarking
- **Quarterly**: Review and update performance baselines

#### Security and Risk Assessment

- âœ… All optimizations are non-invasive and reversible
- âœ… No data loss risk from performance tuning
- âœ… Proper file permissions and system integration
- âœ… Comprehensive audit trail via systemd logging

### File Attribution

All deliverable files include proper source attribution:

```
# From: E01-F01-T05 Storage Performance Optimization
# Target: [deployment location]
```

This ensures traceability and makes the implementation maintainable across the development lifecycle.

## Verification Results


#### I/O Scheduler Verification

```bash
cat /sys/block/nvme*/queue/scheduler
# nvme0n1: [none] mq-deadline âœ…
# nvme1n1: [none] mq-deadline âœ…
```
