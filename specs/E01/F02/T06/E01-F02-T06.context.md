### Session: 2025-08-31

#### Completed Tasks

1. **Master Setup Script (setup-dev-env.sh)**
   - Created comprehensive setup automation script
   - Added OS detection (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Implemented prerequisite checking
   - Added interactive prompts for optional features
   - Included error handling and recovery
   - Added command-line options (--quick, --skip-services, --skip-deps)
   - File: [`scripts/development/setup-dev-env.sh`](../../../../scripts/development/setup-dev-env.sh)

2. **Service Health Check Script (check-services-health.js)**
   - Created Node.js health monitoring script
   - Implemented TCP and HTTP health checks
   - Added support for essential vs optional services
   - Included verbose and JSON output modes
   - Added comprehensive error reporting
   - File: [`scripts/development/check-services-health.js`](../../../../scripts/development/check-services-health.js)

3. **Environment Validation**
   - Confirmed existing [`scripts/development/validate-env.js`](../../../../scripts/development/validate-env.js) from T04
   - Script validates all critical environment variables
   - Checks database configurations
   - Validates KIS account settings
   - Reports errors, warnings, and info

4. **Package.json Workflow Scripts**
   - Added comprehensive developer workflow scripts
   - Organized scripts by category (setup, dev, db, services, etc.)
   - Added Docker service management commands
   - Included database migration and seeding scripts
   - Added testing and code quality commands
   - File: [`package.json`](../../../../package.json)

5. **Developer Documentation (DEVELOPMENT.md)**
   - Created comprehensive development guide
   - Documented architecture overview
   - Added development workflow instructions
   - Included service management guide
   - Documented database operations
   - Added testing strategy
   - Included debugging instructions
   - Comprehensive troubleshooting section
   - File: [`docs/learning/patterns/DEVELOPMENT.md`](../../../../docs/learning/patterns/DEVELOPMENT.md)

6. **Quick Start Guide (QUICKSTART.md)**
   - Created 5-minute setup guide
   - Simple step-by-step instructions
   - Essential commands reference
   - Quick troubleshooting tips
   - Pro tips for efficiency
   - File: [`docs/learning/patterns/QUICKSTART.md`](../../../../docs/learning/patterns/QUICKSTART.md)

#### Files Created/Modified

- ✅ [`scripts/development/setup-dev-env.sh`](../../../../scripts/development/setup-dev-env.sh) - Master setup automation script
- ✅ [`scripts/development/check-services-health.js`](../../../../scripts/development/check-services-health.js)](../../../../scripts/development/check-services-health.js) - Service health monitoring
- ✅ [`package.json`](../../../../package.json) - Updated with workflow scripts
- ✅ [`docs/learning/patterns/DEVELOPMENT.md`](../../../../docs/learning/patterns/DEVELOPMENT.md) - Complete developer guide
- ✅ [`docs/learning/patterns/QUICKSTART.md`](../../../../docs/learning/patterns/QUICKSTART.md) - Quick start guide
- ✅ [`specs/E01/F02/T06/context.md`](./E01-F02-T06.context.md) - This progress tracking file

#### Technical Decisions

1. **Shell Script for Setup**: Used bash for maximum compatibility and direct system interaction
2. **Node.js for Health Checks**: Leveraged JavaScript for better Docker API integration
3. **Yarn Scripts Organization**: Grouped scripts by function for better discoverability
4. **Documentation Structure**: Separated quick start from detailed guide for different audiences

#### Integration Points

- Setup script integrates with existing scripts from T01-T05
- Health check works with Docker Compose configurations from T02
- Package.json scripts utilize Nx for monorepo management
- Documentation references environment setup from T04

#### Next Steps

- Test the complete setup flow on a fresh system
- Commit all changes
- Update spec metadata with completion status
