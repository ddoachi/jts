## Overview

This document tracks the implementation progress of .

## GitHub Issue

- *To be created*

## Implementation Timeline

#### 2025-08-27 - Platform Focus Refinement

- **Decision**: Removed Mac and WebStorm setup instructions from spec
- **Rationale**: JTS is primarily a Linux/Docker-based system for production deployment
- **Impact**: Simplified spec to focus on Docker-based development environment only
- **Participants**: User request based on architecture review

### Key Points Discussed:

1. Mac development can still work through Docker Desktop but isn't a primary target
2. WebStorm users can adapt VS Code configuration as needed
3. Focus on containerized development ensures consistency across team
4. Reduces documentation maintenance burden

### Spec Revisions

### 2025-08-27 - Scope Reduction

- **Change**: Removed sections for Mac-specific setup and WebStorm IDE configuration
- **Before**: Multi-platform setup with IDE-specific configurations
- **After**: Streamlined Docker-focused development environment
- **Benefits**:
  - Cleaner documentation
  - Single source of truth
  - Better alignment with production environment

### Implementation Timeline

### Session 1: 2025-08-27 - Task Breakdown

**Action**: Split feature into tasks
**Method**: Software architect analysis
**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Created Specs**:

- [Task T01: Node.js and Yarn Environment Setup](T01.md) - 2 hours
- [Task T02: VS Code IDE Configuration](T02.md) - 2 hours
- [Task T03: Docker and Database Services Setup](T03.md) - 3 hours
- [Task T04: Environment Configuration and Secrets Management](T04.md) - 2 hours
- [Task T05: Code Quality Tools and Git Hooks](T05.md) - 2 hours
- [Task T06: Development Scripts and Automation](T06.md) - 3 hours

**Rationale**:

- Each task represents a logical, self-contained component
- Tasks have clear dependencies (T01 must be done first)
- Total estimated time: 14 hours
- Tasks can be implemented incrementally

**Key Decisions**:

1. Yarn over npm for better monorepo support
2. VS Code only (removed WebStorm) for consistency
3. Two-file environment strategy (.env.example + .env.local)
4. Docker Compose for all local services
5. Comprehensive automation to reduce setup friction
