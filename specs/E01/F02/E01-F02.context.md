# Context: Development Environment Setup (F02)

**Spec**: [Development Environment Setup](spec.md)
**Status**: planning
**Created**: 2025-08-27
**Updated**: 2025-08-28

## Summary

Feature specification for establishing a standardized development environment for the JTS automated trading system. Split into 6 implementation tasks covering Node.js/Yarn setup, VS Code configuration, Docker services, environment management, code quality tools, and automation scripts.

## Pre-Implementation Discussions

### Pre-Implementation Timeline

#### 2025-08-27 - Platform Focus Refinement

- **Decision**: Removed Mac and WebStorm setup instructions from spec
- **Rationale**: JTS is primarily a Linux/Docker-based system for production deployment
- **Impact**: Simplified spec to focus on Docker-based development environment only
- **Participants**: User request based on architecture review

### Key Points Discussed:

1. Mac development can still work through Docker Desktop but isn't a primary target
2. WebStorm users can adapt VS Code configuration as needed
3. Focus on containerized development ensures consistency across team
4. Reduces documentation maintenance burden

### Spec Revisions

### 2025-08-27 - Scope Reduction

- **Change**: Removed sections for Mac-specific setup and WebStorm IDE configuration
- **Before**: Multi-platform setup with IDE-specific configurations
- **After**: Streamlined Docker-focused development environment
- **Benefits**:
  - Cleaner documentation
  - Single source of truth
  - Better alignment with production environment

## Implementation

## Implementation Planning

### Approach

- Docker-first development environment
- VS Code as recommended IDE with consistent extensions
- Standardized tooling across all developers
- Focus on Linux/WSL2 for non-Linux users

### Deliverables Planned

1. Docker Compose configuration for full dev stack
2. VS Code settings and recommended extensions
3. Environment setup script (Linux/WSL2)
4. Developer onboarding guide

## Notes

- This context file created retroactively to capture pre-implementation discussions
- Ensures important architectural decisions aren't lost
- Will be updated during actual implementation phase

### Implementation Timeline

### Session 1: 2025-08-27 - Task Breakdown

**Action**: Split feature into tasks
**Method**: Software architect analysis
**Duration**: 30 minutes

**Created Specs**:

- [Task T01: Node.js and Yarn Environment Setup](T01.md) - 2 hours
- [Task T02: VS Code IDE Configuration](T02.md) - 2 hours
- [Task T03: Docker and Database Services Setup](T03.md) - 3 hours
- [Task T04: Environment Configuration and Secrets Management](T04.md) - 2 hours
- [Task T05: Code Quality Tools and Git Hooks](T05.md) - 2 hours
- [Task T06: Development Scripts and Automation](T06.md) - 3 hours

**Rationale**:

- Each task represents a logical, self-contained component
- Tasks have clear dependencies (T01 must be done first)
- Total estimated time: 14 hours
- Tasks can be implemented incrementally

**Key Decisions**:

1. Yarn over npm for better monorepo support
2. VS Code only (removed WebStorm) for consistency
3. Two-file environment strategy (.env.example + .env.local)
4. Docker Compose for all local services
5. Comprehensive automation to reduce setup friction

    T01[Node.js/Yarn Setup] --> T02[VS Code Config]
    T01 --> T03[Docker Services]
    T03 --> T04[Environment Config]
    T01 --> T05[Code Quality]
    T02 --> T05
    T01 --> T06[Automation Scripts]
    T02 --> T06
    T03 --> T06
    T04 --> T06
    T05 --> T06
```

## Implementation Order

1. **Task T01** - Foundation (must be first)
2. **Task T03** - Docker services (can run in parallel with T02)
3. **Task T02** - VS Code setup
4. **Task T04** - Environment configuration
5. **Task T05** - Code quality tools
6. **Task T06** - Final automation and documentation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Platform Differences**: Separate scripts for Linux and Windows
- **Credential Security**: Never store secrets in plain text
- **Service Dependencies**: Health checks before proceeding
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive automation and clear documentation

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Complete setup in under 30 minutes on fresh system
- [ ] All services start successfully
- [ ] Development workflow fully automated
- [ ] No manual configuration required
- [ ] Clear troubleshooting documentation

## Notes

- Focus on developer productivity and minimal friction
- Support for multi-account trading architecture
- Security-first approach for credentials
- Scalable from development to production
