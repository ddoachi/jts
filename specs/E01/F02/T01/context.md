# Context for E01-F02-T01: Node.js and Yarn Environment Setup

## Implementation Date
2025-08-31

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Created Installation Scripts
- Created `scripts/install-node-yarn.sh` - Unified installation script with OS detection
- Created `scripts/install-node-yarn-linux.sh` - Linux-specific installer for Node.js 20 LTS and Yarn 4
- Created `scripts/install-node-yarn-windows.ps1` - Windows PowerShell installer with Chocolatey support

### 2. Configured Yarn 4 (Berry)
- Created `.yarnrc.yml` with:
  - node-modules linker for compatibility
  - Workspace configuration
  - Plugin support for workspace tools
  - Network and optimization settings

### 3. Set up Root Package Configuration
- Updated `package.json` with:
  - Monorepo workspace configuration (apps/*, libs/*)
  - Package manager specification (yarn@4.0.0)
  - Engine requirements (Node.js >=20.0.0, Yarn >=4.0.0)
  - Common development scripts (setup, dev, build, test, lint, type-check)
  - Nx workspace integration
  - Existing spec management scripts preserved

### 4. Updated Git Configuration
- Enhanced `.gitignore` with Yarn 4 specific entries:
  - Yarn cache and internal files
  - PnP files
  - Preserved plugin and release directories

## Files Created/Modified
1. `specs/E01/F02/deliverables/scripts/install-node-yarn.sh` - Main installation entry point
2. `specs/E01/F02/deliverables/scripts/install-node-yarn-linux.sh` - Linux installer
3. `specs/E01/F02/deliverables/scripts/install-node-yarn-windows.ps1` - Windows installer
4. `specs/E01/F02/deliverables/config/.yarnrc.yml` - Yarn 4 configuration
5. `specs/E01/F02/deliverables/config/package.json.template` - Workspace-enabled package.json template
6. `specs/E01/F02/deliverables/config/gitignore.template` - Git ignore patterns for Yarn 4

## Deliverables Completed
✅ Node.js 20 LTS installation scripts for Linux and Windows
✅ Yarn 4 (Berry) configuration with Corepack
✅ Workspace-enabled package.json
✅ Platform-specific installation scripts
✅ Git ignore patterns for Yarn 4

## Next Steps
- Run `chmod +x scripts/*.sh` to make scripts executable
- Execute `./scripts/install-node-yarn.sh` to install Node.js and Yarn
- Run `yarn install` to initialize the workspace
- Create `apps/` and `libs/` directories for microservices

## Notes
- Using node-modules linker instead of PnP for better compatibility with existing tools
- Corepack is the official way to manage Yarn versions in Node.js 16+
- Scripts include verification steps to ensure correct versions are installed
