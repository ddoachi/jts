# Context Log for E01-F02-T02: VS Code IDE Configuration

## Implementation Process

### 1. Directory Setup

- Created `.vscode` directory for VS Code workspace configuration

### 2. Workspace Settings Configuration

- Updated [`.vscode/settings.json`](../../../../.vscode/settings.json) with TypeScript optimizations
- Added format on save and ESLint auto-fix
- Configured file and search exclusions for performance
- Integrated Jest test runner settings
- Preserved existing user preferences while adding project-specific settings

### 3. Extensions Setup

- Created `.vscode/extensions.json` with recommended extensions
- Included essential tools: TypeScript, Prettier, ESLint, Jest, Nx Console
- Added database and API testing tools: MongoDB, Database Client, Thunder Client
- Included Docker and YAML support for DevOps workflows

### 4. Debug Configuration

- Enhanced [`.vscode/launch.json`](../../../../.vscode/launch.json) with service-specific debug setups
- Added configurations for API Gateway and Strategy Engine services
- Included test debugging configuration
- Preserved existing "Attach to NestJS" configuration

### 5. Task Automation

- Created `.vscode/tasks.json` for common development operations
- Added tasks for starting services, running tests, and Docker operations
- Used Yarn commands to match project package manager

### 6. Documentation

- Created comprehensive IDE setup guide in deliverables/docs/
- Documented all configurations, usage instructions, and troubleshooting
- Included workflow guidelines and integration notes

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:

- `.vscode/extensions.json` - Recommended extensions list
- `.vscode/tasks.json` - Development task automation
- `specs/E01/F02/deliverables/docs/IDE-SETUP.md` - Setup documentation

### Modified Files:

- [`.vscode/settings.json`](../../../../.vscode/settings.json) - Enhanced with TypeScript/NestJS optimizations
