## Implementation Timeline

### 2025-09-02 20:29: Initial Implementation

### Starting Implementation
- Date: 2025-08-31
- Starting with environment configuration setup based on discussion points

### Completed Implementation
- Date: 2025-08-31
- Created comprehensive .env.example with KIS multi-account configuration (2 active, 3 reserved)
- Implemented setup-env.sh script for automated environment setup
- Created validate-env.js for thorough configuration validation
- Added Creon integration scripts (launcher, encrypt/decrypt credentials)
- Updated .gitignore with security patterns
- Created detailed environment documentation in docs/learning/concepts/ENVIRONMENT.md
- All deliverables moved to natural project locations with spec tracking comments
- Committed with hash: 8d06b99

### Files Created
1. `.env.example` - Environment template with KIS/Creon/Crypto placeholders
2. [[[[`scripts/development/setup-env.sh`](../../../../scripts/development/setup-env.sh)](../../../../scripts/development/setup-env.sh)](../../../../scripts/development/setup-env.sh)](../../../../scripts/development/setup-env.sh) - Automated setup script
3. [[[[`scripts/development/validate-env.js`](../../../../scripts/development/validate-env.js)](../../../../scripts/development/validate-env.js)](../../../../scripts/development/validate-env.js)](../../../../scripts/development/validate-env.js) - Configuration validator
4. `scripts/creon-launcher.bat` - Creon wrapper script
5. `scripts/encrypt-credentials.ps1` - Credential encryption utility
6. `scripts/decrypt-and-run.ps1` - Secure Creon launcher
7. [[[[`docs/learning/concepts/ENVIRONMENT.md`](../../../../docs/learning/concepts/ENVIRONMENT.md)](../../../../docs/learning/concepts/ENVIRONMENT.md)](../../../../docs/learning/concepts/ENVIRONMENT.md)](../../../../docs/learning/concepts/ENVIRONMENT.md) - Complete environment documentation
8. Updated `.gitignore` - Added security patterns

### Implementation Notes
- KIS accounts configured for 2 active accounts with room for 5 total
- Creon structure ready but requires user's auto-login.bat script
- Binance/Upbit configured as disabled placeholders for future use
- All scripts include spec tracking comments for traceability
