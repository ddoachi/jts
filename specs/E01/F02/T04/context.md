# Context for E01-F02-T04: Environment Configuration and Secrets Management

## Pre-Implementation Discussion

**Date**: 2025-08-31
**Discussion Points**:
1. Currently have 2 KIS accounts, may scale up to 5 accounts later
2. No API keys available for Binance or Upbit currently
3. A .bat shell script for auto-login for Creon exists but cannot be shown now

**Implementation Approach Based on Discussion**:
- Configure environment for 2 KIS accounts with scalability for up to 5
- Keep Binance/Upbit configuration as optional placeholders
- Create structure for Creon batch script integration without actual credentials
- Focus on secure credential management framework
